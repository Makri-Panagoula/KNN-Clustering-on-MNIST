The set H including the available hash functions out of which each g-function is constructed has bigger cardinality than k to increase randomness,arbitrarily chosen,here 2*k.The k r-operands are chosen randomly and uniquely for every g-function for the same reason.We use the amplified lsh algorithm.Time in metrics refers to total time of execution of algorithms for all the given query points.We choose the first 10 images of the query set to test the algorithms.
